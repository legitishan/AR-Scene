# AR-Scene
Project https://github.com/Technohacker and I did in 2017/18/19 

Did this for some event at school, slight variation of https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js.(Check his stuff out, super cool.)

We used a-frame (An open-source web framework for building VR stuff,an entity component system framework for Three.js)

We also made custom patterns with our schools logo on it
